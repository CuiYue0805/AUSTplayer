Note:
1.Matlab code can be run directly using MATLAB(version 18a or higher).Run the files in order of their names, but the corresponding parameters need to be adjusted accordingly.
2.The code parameters need to be adjusted in real time according to the different training objects, so there is no fixed value set. The author uses some parameters instead.
